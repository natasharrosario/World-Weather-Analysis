# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose

For this challenge, I used weather description data to enhance the hypothetical PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers then used input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which were used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The beta testers then chose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.

## Results

See attached code and png files to view weather and travel analyses and maps showing both potential travel destinations and suggested travel route.
